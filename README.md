## Part 1: Working with Integers

Write a program to accept 10 integers from the user(on one line, space separated) and for each integer display: 

- How many are divisible by 3
- The number of even numbers 
- The min, max, sum, and average (without using the Math class)
- For the largest number, print the integer’s digits individually

```
Input: 5 2 7 8 10 111 14 3 6 9

3, 6, 9 are divisable by 3.
There are 5 even numbers.
Minimum = 2
Maximum = 111
Sum = 175
Average = 17.5
Largest's digits:
1
1
1
